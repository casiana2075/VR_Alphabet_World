   - The bear explains **where to find writing tools** and what steps to take.  

2️⃣ **Writing Practice:**  
   - All **26 letters** are displayed in the starting room, allowing interaction via **hover mechanics**.  
   - The child picks up a **writing tool** (e.g., **pencil or brush**) and follows **numbered guides** to correctly form each letter.  

3️⃣ **Magical Reward System:**  
   - After successfully writing **six letters**, the child is **teleported to a magical forest**, where the letters **come to life and start flying away**.  
   - The child must **chase and catch** the letters to **complete the level**.  

4️⃣ **Continuous Learning Cycle:**  
   - Once the letters are caught, the child is **transported back** to the learning room to continue practicing new letters.
