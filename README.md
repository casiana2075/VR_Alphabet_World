Progress Week 10: done the script of narrator bear, animations on narrator-bear and hands, added in unity some coliders, grabbers for room environment and fix the XR Origin

Progress Week 11 - https://youtu.be/F_gXaxLkFjc

  ● For this week, we implemented the following: the bear narrator can now teleport to all the given environments and deliver lines with distinct scripts tailored for each situation (introduction, forest, pyramids, island, desert, and explaining the game to the child). Additionally, we animated the narrator with idle and talking animations. We also worked on enabling all the necessary adjustments to allow drawing on the board using a pencil.

  ● Also the writing mechanism is in a starting state, worked on the board and pen and we will improve user experience in future.
  
  ● All features related to the bear narrator can be seen in the accompanying video.

Progress Week 12:

  ● Fade-In and Fade-Out Animation for Teleportation:
We implemented a smooth and simultaneous fade-in and fade-out animation to enhance the teleportation experience. You can see this in the attached video demonstration (https://youtu.be/cyrxy0Nzn6I).

  ● Alphabet Tracing Guidelines:
We designed detailed and child-friendly guidelines for each letter of the alphabet entirely from scratch. Progress has been documented through images showcasing the design process and final output.

 ● Interactive Writing Tools:
We completed the functionality for both the brush and pencil, allowing children to draw and write directly on the board. Images illustrating this interactive feature highlight how it creates a fun and engaging learning experience.
