Bocăneț Raluca-Andreea & Maxim Casiana & Popoiu Andra-Ștefania - IMR3

**Progress video Week 7**: https://youtu.be/eOuIIhL2H7o

**Progress Week 10**: done the script of the narrator bear, animations on narrator-bear and hands, added in unity some colliders, grabbers for room environment, and fix the XR Origin

**Progress Week 11** - https://youtu.be/F_gXaxLkFjc

  ● For this week, we implemented the following: the bear narrator can now teleport to all the given environments and deliver lines with distinct scripts tailored for each situation (introduction, forest, pyramids, island, desert, and explaining the game to the child). Additionally, we animated the narrator with idle and talking animations. We also worked on enabling all the necessary adjustments to allow drawing on the board using a pencil.

  ● Also the writing mechanism is in a starting state, worked on the board and pen and we will improve user experience in the future.
  
  ● All features related to the bear narrator can be seen in the accompanying video.

**Progress Week 12**:

  ● Fade-In and Fade-Out Animation for Teleportation:
We implemented a smooth and simultaneous fade-in and fade-out animation to enhance the teleportation experience. You can see this in the attached video demonstration (https://youtu.be/cyrxy0Nzn6I).

  ● Alphabet Tracing Guidelines:
We designed detailed and child-friendly guidelines for each letter of the alphabet entirely from scratch. Progress has been documented through images showcasing the design process and final output.

 ● Interactive Writing Tools:
Interactive Writing Tools: We completed the functionality for both the brush and pencil, allowing children to draw and write directly on the board. We also implemented a Shader Graph for the whiteboard, enabling more dynamic and visually appealing effects. Images illustrating these interactive features highlight how they create a fun and engaging learning experience.

**Progress Week 13**:

  ● This week, we created a cutscene for the application's intro using Unity's timeline. The timeline integrates sound, character animation, and recorded camera movements to establish an immersive introduction. (https://youtu.be/dItrqCMl9ys)

  ● We also implemented grab interactions and hand animations in Unity to enhance user experience, making interactions more natural and engaging.

  ● The writing mechanism on the board is currently in progress. Users can start writing letters on the board with a pen, but we plan to refine and improve this feature for a smoother experience.
